Welcome to my Blog! I have never done this before, but this seems like a good time to start.

Today is my first day as a Microsoft FTE converting from a contractor. I had been working as a contractor since January 2020 (1 year, 5 months, 22 days)!

Keep checking back for more information, this will be continually updated as time permits.
